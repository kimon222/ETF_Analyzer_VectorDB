# What are ETFs?

Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are a popular investment option that allows investors to buy a collection of assets, such as stocks, bonds, or commodities, in a single trade. ETFs are designed to track the performance of a specific index, sector, or asset class.

## Key Features of ETFs:
- **Diversification**: Investing in an ETF provides instant diversification since they hold a basket of securities.
- **Liquidity**: ETFs trade on stock exchanges, meaning they can be bought and sold throughout the day, just like individual stocks.
- **Low Cost**: Compared to mutual funds, ETFs tend to have lower expense ratios.
- **Transparency**: The underlying assets of most ETFs are disclosed daily, providing transparency to investors.

ETFs are suitable for both beginner and experienced investors, offering flexibility and low costs.
