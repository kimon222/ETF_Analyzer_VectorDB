# Overview of Different Types of ETFs

There are several types of ETFs available for investors, each focusing on different asset classes or investment strategies. Here are some common types:

### 1. Stock ETFs
Stock ETFs invest in a wide range of stocks and are often designed to track specific indexes such as the S&P 500 or NASDAQ-100. These are great for investors looking to diversify within the equity market.

### 2. Bond ETFs
Bond ETFs invest in various bonds (government, corporate, or municipal). These ETFs are typically considered safer than stock ETFs and provide fixed income through bond yields.

### 3. Sector ETFs
Sector ETFs focus on specific sectors of the economy such as technology, healthcare, or energy. These ETFs are good for investors who want targeted exposure to particular industries.

### 4. Commodity ETFs
Commodity ETFs invest in physical assets like gold, oil, or agricultural products. They provide a way to invest in commodities without having to buy the physical product.

ETFs are a flexible and low-cost way to build a diversified investment portfolio.
