# Basic ETF Investment Strategies

Investing in Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) offers a straightforward approach to diversify your portfolio with lower fees than traditional mutual funds. In this document, we'll cover basic ETF investment strategies that beginners can use to build a solid investment foundation.

The most common basic strategies include:
- **Buy and Hold**: Investing in broad market ETFs and holding them for the long term.
- **Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)**: Investing a fixed amount of money into an ETF at regular intervals, regardless of market conditions.
- **Core-Satellite Strategy**: Using low-cost broad-market ETFs as the core of your portfolio while adding satellite positions in specific sectors or themes.

These strategies can help you reduce risk, avoid emotional trading, and stay focused on your long-term investment goals.
