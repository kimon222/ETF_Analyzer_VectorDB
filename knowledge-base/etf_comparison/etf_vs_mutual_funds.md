# ETFs vs. Mutual Funds: A Comparison

When considering investment options, many investors find themselves deciding between Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and Mutual Funds. Both are investment vehicles that pool money from many investors to buy a diversified portfolio of assets, but they have key differences.

Key differences between ETFs and Mutual Funds:
- **Trading Mechanism**: ETFs are traded on exchanges like stocks, while mutual funds are bought and sold through the fund company at the end of the trading day.
- **Costs**: ETFs generally have lower expense ratios compared to mutual funds, but mutual funds may have no transaction fees for purchases.
- **Management Style**: Most ETFs are passively managed, tracking indexes, whereas mutual funds are often actively managed.
- **Liquidity**: ETFs offer more liquidity since they can be bought and sold throughout the trading day.

Understanding these differences is crucial in deciding which investment vehicle fits your personal financial goals and investment strategy.
